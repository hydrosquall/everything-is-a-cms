Grilled cheese is a classic American sandwich that is usually prepared with one or more cheese varieties that are placed between two slices of bread. The slices are buttered from the outside, and the sandwich is then shortly heated, typically in a pan or on a griddle, until the bread is golden and the cheese melts.

Although cheese and bread were a common pairing since the early 1900s, and the French have their own, similar Croque Monsieur sandwich, grilled cheese sandwich first appeared in the United States in the 1920s, when it was prepared open-faced, as a slice of bread topped with shredded cheese.
